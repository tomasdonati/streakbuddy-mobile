# Project Planning (Shared)

This document holds **platform-agnostic, implementation-ready specifications** that apply to both Android and iOS. It is the source of truth for product scope, core flows, and data models that should remain consistent across platforms.

Use platform-specific planning files for implementation details:
- `ProjectPlanning.Android.md`
- `ProjectPlanning.iOS.md`

---

## How This Document Is Updated

- Content is promoted here only after it is refined in `ProjectBrainstorming.md`.
- Decisions here should be stable enough to guide implementation on any platform.
- If platform differences exist, capture the shared intent here and the specifics in the platform file.
